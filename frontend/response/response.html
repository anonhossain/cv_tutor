            <h2>Main Key Skills and Projects Missing from the CV</h2>
            <p><strong>1. Experience specifically in Growth Data Analysis:</strong> The resume shows data analysis skills applied to sales and credit card data, but lacks demonstrable experience focused on user growth, acquisition, and retention. The projects don't explicitly address these growth-focused metrics.</p>
            <p><strong>2. A/B Testing Experience:</strong> While the candidate mentions using Power BI and SQL, there is no mention of designing, implementing, and analyzing A/B tests, a core requirement of the job.</p>
            <p><strong>3. Quantifiable Growth Results:</strong> The resume mentions a 28.8% revenue increase but does not demonstrate how this growth was driven by data analysis and insights. More quantifiable achievements are necessary to showcase impact on growth metrics.</p>
            <p><strong>4. Portfolio Showcasing Work:</strong> The job description explicitly asks for a portfolio, and the resume only provides project links without further detail or context.</p>
            <p><strong>5. Experience with Specific Growth Hacking Techniques:</strong> The job description mentions staying up-to-date with growth hacking best practices. The CV lacks examples of applying these techniques.</p>
